### Henry comments 13/April
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- Changelog is empty.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.


### Henry comments 27/April
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Your changelog - maybe format it in markdown so it's readable in github (view it from github web page and you'll see what I mean)
- Your data has made a great start. I'd suggest building it up a bit more, given we're in Week 7 now.
